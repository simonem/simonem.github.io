# Simone Mora, PhD


I am a Research Scientist at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)][mit] and an Adjunct Associate Professor at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)][ntnu].

My work focuses on the intersection of IoT and AI technologies, societies, and the built environment. I am interested in research that can be translated directly into action.

At MIT’s [Senseable City Lab][scl], I lead research in urban sensing: developing low-cost, scalable tools to capture hyperlocal variations in environmental indicators such as air quality, noise levels, and thermal flux in the built environment.

Projects I led have been published in *Nature Sustainability*, *Nature Cities*, *Nature Humanities & Social Sciences Communications*, *IEEE Sensors Journal*, *Elsevier HardwareX*, and *ACM DIS*. They have been exhibited at the 2023 Venice Biennale of Architecture and MIT museum, featured by several media outlets including Fast Company, the World Economic Forum, and MIT News. Recognitions include the IEEE IoT World Forum Best Paper Award and an Honorable Mention from Fast Company’s Innovation by Design Awards.

I lecture in the field of Design Thinking, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence. I am an  instructor of MIT course 11.320 “Digital City Workshop”. I am a co-inventor of Tiles Inventor Toolkit - an ideation toolkit to tackle the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by hundreds of research and education organizations globally. I am co-inventor of the [Tiles Inventor Toolkit][tiles] —an ideation tool addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals— adopted by hundreds of research and education institutions worldwide.

I hold a PhD Degree in Computer Science from [NTNU][ntnu], and an MSc Degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Bergamo][unibg].

In Boston, I run with [Midnight Runners][]mr.
